# 3d-rendering
A small C# library for manipulating objects in 3d space and rendering them. Emphasis on manipulating.
you can use it by adding a reference to the .dll in your project and inserting the following line in your code:
```c#
using Graphics3D;
```
Poke through the source if you're interested. The naming is prety straightforward and it's mostly commented. I can't be bothered to write a documentation/manual.


This project borrows a lot of names from the [UnityEngine](https://unity3d.com/) library however it is not otherwise related. This is my original code and was created as a learning experience for myself and shared for others.
