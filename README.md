# 3d-rendering
A small C# library for manipulating objects in 3d space and rendering them.
you can use it by adding a reference to the .dll in your project and inserting the following line in your code:
```c#
using Graphics3D;
```
Primatives.cs has a little more information on how to set up a scene/camera.

This project borrows a lot of names from the [UnityEngine](https://unity3d.com/) library however it is not otherwise related. This is my original code and was created as a learning experience for myself and shared for others.
